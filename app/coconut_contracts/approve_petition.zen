Scenario coconut: approve petition
Given that I have a valid 'verifier' from 'MadHatter'
and I have a valid 'credential proof'
and I have a valid 'petition'
When I aggregate the verifiers
and I verify the credential proof
and I verify the new petition to be empty
Then print the 'petition'
and print the 'verifiers'
