Scenario coconut: aggregate petition signature
Given that I have a valid 'petition signature'
and I have a valid 'petition'
and I have a valid 'verifiers'
When the petition signature is not a duplicate
and the petition signature is just one more
and I add the signature to the petition
Then print the 'petition'
and print the 'verifiers'
