Credential issuer API is part of the DDDC.
Digital Democracy and Data Commons is a pilot participatory process oriented to test a new technology to improve the 
digital democracy platform Decidim and to collectively imagine the data politics of the future. This pilot takes place 
in the context of the European project [DECODE (Decentralized Citizen Owned Data Ecosystem)](https://decodeproject.eu) 
that aims to construct legal, technological, and socioeconomic tools that allow citizens to take back control over their
data and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving
people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along
[privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) 
using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.
